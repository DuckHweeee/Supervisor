SMART BUILDING HVAC SYSTEM MANUAL

System Overview:
The smart building is equipped with an advanced HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system that includes:
- Centralized control system with IoT sensors
- Automated temperature regulation
- Energy-efficient heat pumps
- Zone-based climate control
- Air quality monitoring

Key Components:
1. Main Control Unit (MCU-2024)
   - Location: Mechanical Room B1
   - IP Address: 192.168.1.100
   - Manages overall system operations

2. Temperature Sensors (TS-101 to TS-150)
   - Distributed throughout all floors
   - Wireless connectivity via ZigBee protocol
   - Battery life: 2-3 years

3. Air Quality Sensors (AQ-201 to AQ-220)
   - Monitors CO2, humidity, and particulate matter
   - Real-time data transmission to MCU
   - Calibration required every 6 months

4. Smart Thermostats (ST-301 to ST-350)
   - Touchscreen interface in each zone
   - Mobile app connectivity
   - Learning algorithm for occupancy patterns

Operating Parameters:
- Normal temperature range: 68째F - 76째F (20째C - 24째C)
- Humidity target: 40% - 60%
- CO2 levels: <1000 ppm
- System operational hours: 24/7 with efficiency scheduling

Maintenance Schedule:
